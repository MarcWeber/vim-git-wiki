= opening files in vim =

== using vim only tools ==
{{{
typing ctrl-o: open last file (after restarting vim)
:e/n **/*foo.txt<c-d> or <tab> to find a file

r!find<cr> then gf on a file
}}}

== using additional plugins ==

The_NERD_tree plugin is popular, because it has a tree view. However

{{https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager/blob/master/autoload/sample_vimrc_for_new_users.vim}} has a very simple glob open implementation. Many famous alternatives exist:

Command-T plugin (requires ruby, thus you may have little trouble setting it up)
ctrlp.vim
FuzzyFinder
(How do they compare, which plugin do people prefer for what reason?)

(TODO)

also [../topics/tags] like features can be used.
