= git =
git is a "stupid" content tracker by design. Which means it almost only tracks
content, and has some additional support for merging braches built on top of
that. Originally it has been written by linux kernel devs to keep track of the
huge kernel source changes - which is why they cared much about speed.

git soon became very popular by devs because it usually gets its job done only
having minor issues.
