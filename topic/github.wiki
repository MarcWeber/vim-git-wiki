Github is a proprietary project hosting git repositories.

[[topic/version-control-systems]]
[[topic/git]]

It is still friendly to open source people, because hosting for public
repositories is free. All you need is an account, then you can pick a project,
hack on it, and provide patches via pull requests. Once you get used to it its
pretty simple which is why the source of this wiki is hosted that way, too.
Most people know git reasonable well.

For this and similar reasons its very popular among open source developers.
There are alternatives such as bitbucket and gitorious etc.

The github page of this wiki currently is {{github.com/MarcWeber/vim-git-wiki}}
which might change in the future.
