= vimwiki-vs-mediawiki =

== WIKI (such as a drupal wiki, mediawiki) online editable page: ==
+ you can edit in place - the page you're reading by clicking on _edit_
  link
+ faster preview
- drupal vulnerabilities are likely to exist, see
  http://drupal.org/security
? you can't read it offline (well probably you can render it as PDF or
  HTML) - but then you can't edit.
? what about spam ?
? requires additional logins - or hook into the vim.sf.net's databse
? there is a way to edit pages with vim using APIs (which are slower,
  and tools such as grep are useless ?)
? how to reset spamming ?

== vimwiki like: ==
+ no spam
+ you can use vim for edting and reading
+ you can use grep
+ its fast (git pull, hack, push)
+ its distributed
+ branch support
+ under control (you can't hack html files, can you?)
+ no lock in, if you want to switch to a full blown wiki later, it
  should be easy to convert content.
+ editing many files is painless and fast
