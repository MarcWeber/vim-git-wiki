= version control systems =

Also see [[../topic/github]].

version control systems serve these purposes:
- Allow to understand the history of a project
- allow many developers to work at code at the same time

== centralized version control systems ==
Examples: CVS, SVN

Centralized version control systems tend to require a server which holds all history
drawbacks:
- single point of failure
- you depend on internet access
- you must have an account to be able to publish your changes

== distributed version control systems ==
fossil, git, mercurial, bazaar, monotone, (and probably some more, see Wikipedia)

typical workflow
1) get a copy of the history (which often is called cloning)
2) hack and save (commit/record/..) your changes
3) publish on your own location and tell maintainers about your changes, so
   that they can pick them up
