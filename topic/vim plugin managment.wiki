= plugin management =

Traditionally plugins were mantained manually by extracting files into
$HOME/.vim. Wrong about this approach is that its hard to maintain because its
you having to keep track about which files belong to what plugin.
:h plugin  tells you about this traditional way.

The next advanced way is create a directory for each plugin like this:

  ~/.vim/plugin-A/plugin/a.vim
  ~/.vim/plugin-A/filetype/a.vim
  ~/.vim/plugin-B/plugin/a.vim
  ~/.vim/plugin-B/filetype/a.vim

and add to your .vimrc:

  set runtimepath+=~/.vim/plugin-A
  set runtimepath+=~/.vim/plugin-B

This tells Vim that it should look for plugin files to source at startup in
additional directories.

This is tedious, which is why Pathogen, Vundle and VAM automate this.

Feature matrix:

manipulate runtimepath: VAM, Pathogen, Vundle
install from git repositories: VAM, Vundle
install other sources: VAM
activate plugins at runtime: VAM
supports dependencies: VAM
plugin name completion and info: VAM

Now it migh look that being able to install from git repositories only is a major disadvantage.
Its not because there is vim-scripts.org mirroring www.vim.org plugins in git repositories.
