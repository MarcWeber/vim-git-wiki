vim-git-wiki
============

contribute: See topic/contributing-to-this-wiki.wiki
feedback: See topic/contributing-to-this-wiki.wiki -> submitting bugs

purpose: create a manually mantained index about which tools exist to solve
what purpose. Be as dynamic and vibrant as the world and community is: manage
everything by a simple git repository and hope that people contribute (which
usually works pretty well).

status/goal: I want to make this all visible on vim.sf.net to help community be
most productive fastest - which is what Vim is about.



Assign maintainers which are responsible for certain kinds of content, so that
work is not too much for any individual

The final goal is to generate HTML out of this wiki and put it on www.vim.org.
I had in mind rewriting the whole web site, but it would take too much time so
I want to apply the 20/80 rule again: Provide value to users with minimal
effort

On the mailinglist vimwiki was recommended - so let's give it a try.

Please be aware that authors always write about what they know best.
Thus if you have made different experiences contribute and help making this a
better resource.
