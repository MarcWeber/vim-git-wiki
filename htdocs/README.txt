===========

This contains the demo hosted at
http://vim-wiki.mawercer.de/wiki/ [1]

Its a minimalistic wiki allowing users to edit git contents online without
logging in. All you need is git in PATH and PHP with system support.

setting up
==========
copy htdocs to your the web account. Rename lib/config.php.example  to
lib/config.php and edit its settings

[1]
The wiki is run by a copy of the git repository, thus changing the PHP code
will not affect the web application unless administrators copy the code
manually.
