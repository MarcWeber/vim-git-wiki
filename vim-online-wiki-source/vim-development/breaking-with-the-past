= Why could / should this be done?

Currently Vim trieas to be copmatible as much as possible. What would you do
different today, if you could  start from scratch?

* enable nocompatible, enable set hidden
* implement proper threading support, so that you can use python threads etc to
  write interface code like "netbeans, sniff, async feature"
* web enable (is this feasable at all?)
* get rid of the complicated errorformat (use simple regex)
* make the quickfix cycle sane, eg while the process run update a real buffer,
  and allow continuing editing
* make the command line behave like vi buffer? (modes), allow multiline
  commands?

Is there much more? Except those features "we want to edit text", and Vim is
already very good at it. Thus Marc Weber thinks fixing is better than rewriting
