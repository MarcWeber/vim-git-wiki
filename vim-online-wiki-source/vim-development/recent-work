= Which features do people work on?
Note: Most small thing will be sent to the vim-dev mailinglist. Subscribing is
a good idea :)

== Have a look at the main repository and its mirrors
See [[vim-development/development]]

== Marc Weber wants
* improve async support
* make scripting languages like python interruptable
* in the long run support other scripting languages equally well - so that they
  could replace VimL. Currently community is focusing on Python improvements
* Eventually wants to find out whether gobjectIntrospcetion like apis could be
  used to provide the same bindings for almost all scripting languages easily.

* Marc Weber eventually wants to set up a mirror for all scripts - especially
  the ones having a mercurial and git url only. Submitting an url should be all
  you need. This is unrelated to vim-dev. Not enough time the moment

== ZyX
Is heavily working on improving the Python API. His description about the changes:
