= Which features do people work on?
Note: Most small thing will be sent to the vim-dev mailinglist. Subscribing is
a good idea :)


== Have a look at the main repository and its mirrors
See [[vim-development/development]]

== Marc Weber wants
* improve async support
* make scripting languages like python interruptable
* in the long run support other scripting languages equally well - so that they
  could replace VimL. Currently community is focusing on Python improvements
* Eventually wants to find out whether gobjectIntrospcetion like apis could be
  used to provide the same bindings for almost all scripting languages easily.

* Marc Weber eventually wants to set up a mirror for all scripts - especially
  the ones having a mercurial and git url only. Submitting an url should be all
  you need. This is unrelated to vim-dev. Not enough time the moment
* Marc Weber eventually wants to prepare Vim-Nox so that it can be included -
* offering the no-X and the X client-server implementation at the same time?


== ZyX
Is heavily working on improving the Python API. His description about the changes:
[[https://gist.github.com/ZyX-I/5561409]]


== unfinished patches
**Vim-Nox**:
[[https://code.google.com/r/yukihironakadaira-vim-cmdsrv-nox/|Vim-Nox patch, branch cmdsrv-nox]]:
It implements client-server communication using sockets. Using sockets you may
also have more control about who can connect to your vim, if you use proper
access rights for the socket file.

**async**:
[[http://github.com/bartman/vim|async]]:
async patch. vim-addon-async provide similar features - however its based on
client-server. For Vim it works. gui implementations are missing

If python gets implemented proberly, so that even python threads can call back
into Vim then this patch may be obsolete.

**tagfnuc**:
[[http://repo.or.cz/w/vim_extended.git/shortlog/refs/heads/feat/tagfunc|tagfunc patch]]:
I don't know much about it. Its used by
[[https://github.com/MarcWeber/SmartTag/blob/master/doc/SmartTag.txt|SmartTag]]


**text objects**:
Don't know about the status, just adding them for completness:

    (mail by Christian Wellenbrock to vim_use)
    You are absolutely right. Here are two related discussions over at vim_dev.

    [1] Patch to utilize undefined text-objects
    [2] patch for block textobj search

    We're also having a small discussion about these patches over at /r/vim. [3]

    One major difference between our approaches is that I treat separators differently from quotes, as illustrated in the `da,` exampl
    If I'm not mistaken that would not be possible with these patches.
