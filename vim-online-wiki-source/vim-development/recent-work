= Which features do people work on?
Note: Most small thing will be sent to the vim-dev mailinglist. Subscribing is
a good idea :)

== Have a look at the main repository and its mirrors
See [[vim-development/development]]

== Marc Weber wants
* improve async support
* make scripting languages like python interruptable
* in the long run support other scripting languages equally well - so that they
  could replace VimL. Currently community is focusing on Python improvements
* Eventually wants to find out whether gobjectIntrospcetion like apis could be
  used to provide the same bindings for almost all scripting languages easily.

== ZyX
