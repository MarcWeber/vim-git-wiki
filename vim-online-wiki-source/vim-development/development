= how development of Vim is taking place
Bram is reviewing patches and applying them upstream. The last patch state can always be
found at the [[https://code.google.com/p/vim|mercurial repository at code.google.com]]

When does a new release happen?
* whenever the patch count gets close to 1000
* whenever huge new features happens
* other reasons

However code.google.com is lacking some social features which is why we want to
provide official bitbucket and github mirrors

== official bug tracker (?):
[[https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list|issues @ vim @ code.google.com]]
I don't think there is a need to change that

Thus if you want to help and don't know what to do pick an item and solve it :)

== how to submit patches - ask for review?
Sent the patch or a pull request link to the
[[http://www.vim.org/community.php|vim-dev]] mailinglist.

== which features do people work on ?
See [[vim-development/recent-work]]

== code formatting
Yes, this should be documented in the repo (TODO)
{{{
:set sts=4 sw=4 ts=8
}}}
However its not consistent

== details github mirror:
Adding {{{.patch}}} to a pull request yields the diff file

Currently two exist:
* [[https://github.com/vim-jp/vim]]     (very current, only master branch)
* [[https://github.com/b4winckler/vim]] (lacks behind 2 days - on 5. Juni 2013, all brannches)

TODO: Which one should we prefer making pull requests against for what reasons?

== details bitbucket:
It does not exist yet ? (TODO)

== why github and bitbucket mirrors?
Because both features which are of interest to the community such as being able
to submit "pull requests", comment on individual lines of commits etc.

== why git & mercurial mirrors only?
* github supports the SVN protocol
* It looks like git and mercurial are the two version control systems being used
  most be the community.
If you want to support yet another mirror document it here.

== syncing mirrors with each other
Not supported (yet). I don't know about existing solutions. Eventually "hg-git"
extension or such could be tried.

== mercurial vs git ? which one is better?
Both provide advanced features. Marc Weber slightly prefers git because it has
the "remotes" feature. Example:
{{{
git remote add other-developer git-url
git fetch other-developer
# list all branches, the branches from other-developer will be prefixed by the
# remote name "other-developer"
git branch -a
}}}

== keeping your own work up to date
[[http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/PatchBranchExtension|PatchBranchExtension]] (hg)
and [[http://repo.or.cz/w/topgit.git|topgit]] (git) both allow to keep hacking
on multiple branches which may depend on each other and keeping them up to
date. Finally you can export one patch easily

Marc Weber has written a [[https://nixos.org/wiki/Nixpkgs_and_TopGit|top git introduction]].
The PatchBranchExtension is documented at the link above very well.

== last but not least
Do whatever works for you
