= replace C by

The following topics could be of interest deciding upon which language to use
  * side effect tracing, eg see D,Haskell, Zimbu does not have that
  * nice and short clean syntax like ruby/haskell
  * statically typed (there will be a lot of code), this will reduce bugs

nice to have:
* continuation passing style transformation (then you could go JS)

open questions:
* everything is data / type classes vs everything is an object?
