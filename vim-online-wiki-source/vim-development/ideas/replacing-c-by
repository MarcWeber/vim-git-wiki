= replace C by

The following topics could be of interest deciding upon which language to use
  * side effect tracing, eg see D,Haskell, Zimbu does not have that
  * nice and short clean syntax like ruby/haskell
  * statically typed (there will be a lot of code), this will reduce bugs

nice to have:
* continuation passing style transformation (then you could go JS)

open questions:
* everything is data / type classes vs everything is an object?

== D?

== Zimbu

== C++
{{{
    I used D for a project and I quickly went back to C++. When it works
    fine it is probably better than C++, but in my experience it is rare.
    I my opinion all the reason to dislike C++ disappeared with C++11.

comment: Yzis is written in C++, but maintainers have given up because it got
too complicated.

== by something new
pypy serves as an example how such a tool could look like. It already
implements many backends.
