= TODO
You can add arbitrary tasks here you think somebody should do in his spare time..

* think about whether we should use existing markdown - is the MATRIX code that
  important? For me its fastest and easiest.
* license?
  vim wikia wiki uses: [[http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Community_Central:Licensing]]
  which requires attribution of authors
* support redirect from old "names" to new names
