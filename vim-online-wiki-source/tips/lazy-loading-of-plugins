== lazy loading of plugins
Today Marc Weber recommends vim-addon-manager for "lazy loading", because it
even triggers VimEnter for plugins you load at runtimes. Some plugins such as
"the nerd tree" use that. I think its most easy and complete solution.

An example configuration automatically loading plugins whenever you edit a specific file type can be found its
[[https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager/blob/master/doc/vim-addon-manager-getting-started.txt#L229|documentation]]
(line 229)

Eg have a look at the "Example .vimrc setups" for VAM and Vundle at [[topic/vim plugin managment]].
Using multiple directories also Pathogen can be used, sure.

== custom & alternative solutions
There are many other solutions. Eg the
[[http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=915|asneeded]]
plugin. In fact you can replace all "commands" by fake commands which load the
plugin, and then call the command again.

Eg Vim also has the {{{FuncUndefined}}} au group event.

... I may have missed some options
