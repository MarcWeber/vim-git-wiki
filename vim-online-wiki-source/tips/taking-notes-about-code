github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-other contains a Bookmark command.

There are various plugins which can show marks for location or quikfix
list, thus using :cfile to load the bookmarks into quickfix then using
one of the following two plugins:

Examples:
- github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-signs 
  This provides a simple function for placing a list of signs

  :UpdateQuickfixSigns is the sample implementation doing that

- https://github.com/tomtom/quickfixsigns_vim

- syntastic has such feature (but does a lot more ..)

Then mapping :cnext :cprevious could be reasonable fast if you have only
a couple of comments for each file.
