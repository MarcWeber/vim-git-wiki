= optimizing startup time
== measuring startup time
Linux:
{{{
time vim -e -c :quit
}}}

== What is making Vim slow?
* usually plugins loading many code, even if you seldomly use them

== The fix(es)
* Don't activate plugins always. See [[tips/lazy-loading-of-plugins]]
* Make a plugin run only initialization code at startup, make it delay
  loading code its using when the feature is requested.

  This big difference can be seen by [[http://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-commenting]]
  vs "The nerd commenter". The plugin file of vim-addon-commenting is about 26 lines,
  "The nerd commenter" always loads 2700 lines (last tested June 2013).

  Basically the fix here is: Use a different plugin or provide patches moving most code
  which is not always used into {{{autoload/*}}} files.
