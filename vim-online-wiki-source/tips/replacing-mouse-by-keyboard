When starting using Vim you'll have a hard time finding out which is the best way:
* use keyboard
* use mouse

And the answer is not easy always.

Thus let's show some commonly used technics to be most productive with mouse

== resizing windows
{{{c-w 20 | or c-w 40 _ }}} can be used. Alternative: [[https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-other/blob/master/plugin/vim-addon-other.vim|vim-addon-other]]

Important pieces of code to look for:
{{{
  " faster navigation in windows:
  for i in ["i","j","k","l","q","h"]
    exec 'noremap <m-s-'.i.'> <c-w>'.i
  endfor

  " fast resizing of windows:
  noremap <m-w> :call vim_addon_other#SetWindowSize("h")<cr>
  " m-s-w could make trouble ..
  noremap <m-s-w> :call vim_addon_other#SetWindowSize("w")<cr>

  " make it work in Vim
  for i in split("abdgimnpqrstuxyzABDGHIJKLMNPQRSTUXYZ0123456789",'.\zs')
    exec 'map <esc>'.i.' <m-'.i.'>'
  endfor

}}}
Details see that repository, copy paste what you like.


== jumping to locations
{{{:h motion}}} is important to read. Tricks like {{{/s l}}} to match "Tricks
like" is fastset often. ttoc like plugins can help jumping to function
definitions or finding words etc etc.


== TODO
add more ideas how to replace mouse with more effective tools
