== problem: when diffing and using :diffoff Vim forgets about the previous foldmethod

outdated: there is a patch on the vim-dev mailinglist

Gary Johnson posted this solution on the mailinglist to vim_dev on May 25 2013  7:45PM:

This autocommand remembers the foldmethod of each buffer.

{{{
    " Remember the current 'foldmethod' so that it can be restored
    " after a diff by the Nodiff or Undiff command.
    "
    au BufWinEnter * if &fdm != "diff" | let b:fdm = &fdm | endif
}}}

Rather than use :diffoff, I use my own commands such as the
following Undiff to exit diff mode and clean up related settings
such as 'foldmethod'.

{{{
    command! -bar -bang Undiff let wn=winnr()
        \ <bar> diffoff!
        \ <bar> windo set foldlevel=99
        \ <bar> set virtualedit=
        \ <bar> windo exe 'if exists("b:fdm") <bar> let &fdm = b:fdm <bar> endif'
        \ <bar> windo exe 'if exists("b:syn") <bar> let &l:syn = b:syn <bar> endif'
        \ <bar> exe wn . 'wincmd w'
}}}
