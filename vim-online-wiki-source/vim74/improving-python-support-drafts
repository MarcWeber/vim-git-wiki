= How would perfect python support look like for Vim?
* threading support
* a way to write your plugins using python only. See startup dir below
* a way to halt python execution, eg by pressing ctrl-c (TODO)
* a nice API, See ZyX's description about changes below
* what about pip integration? See below

== api changes
[[https://gist.github.com/ZyX-I/5561409|ZyX's description about changes]]

Another crazy idea would be providing a gobject introspection like api.
This could be picked up by almost all scripting languages easily.
I've no idea whether this is possible or not. So extending the current API
seems to be the way to go for now.

== startup dir ==
We cannot put .py plugins into plugin, because some older plugins may have
placed their code their not expecting them to load randomly at startup.
Example plugin doing so: UltiSnips

Thus we need a new name.

* {{{pyplugin/}}}, would sound like "plugin"
* {{{startup/}}}, would be descriptive, and support for loading ruby, perl, ..
  files could be added supported easily
Which one is better, why ?


letting the user configure *which files to load*
Currently Vim has loadplugins option. If we want to support also ruby, perl
this way it would make sense to use one option for all:
{{{
loadplugins = 1 # be backward compatible: load vim only
loadpugins = vim,python2,python3 # load vim,python2,python3 plugins
}}}

This would scale well, because 'ruby' or 'perl' could be added later.
 
== how to hide one plugins implementation from each other ?
Polluting global name space is not really an option. I agree with ZyX.

There are two known ways: {{{execfile}}} and {{{imp.load_source}}}

[[vim74/comparing-execfile-vs-load_source]]

Summary: load_source does put variables and functions in both locals() and globals() whereas
execfile puts assigments into globals() and functions into locals()


When hiding plugins from each other, **how to access user settings** assigned in
.vimrc ?
{{{
  import __main__
  if hasattr(__main__, 'user_setting'):
    # use user setting
}}}

How can plugins **access each other**?
{{{
import other_plugin
other_plugin.add_listener(whatsoever)
}}}
If you use execfile this would require either accessing the globals/locals
dictionary or writing an additional .py file, so that you can import something.

If rtp would be known by python, eg using import hooks and searching in
{{{
  [ join(p, "python-lib") for p in vim.eval(&rtp) ]
}}}
importing other plugins would be easy

== pip integration
Marc Weber thinks pip is great. But he is not sure that forcing pip is the way
to go. Today its pip, tomorrow it might be pip-next.

That's why I'd like to find a solution which we can recommend as "best
practises" without forcing it on users.
Should it be built into Vim?

If I understood ZyX correctly he'd like that.
