Yes - we know this solution is not perfect - its a temporary solution only.

== The perfect solution
would replace vim.sf.net.

* automatically generate install instructions for vundle,pathogen,vam
  Thus it would read the addon-info.json file I introduced for
  simple dependency management
* would allow adding git urls to keep install and project description up
  to date by polling that git url - without duplicating the information in 3
  places (vim.sf.net install section, README, doc/* files)
* allow searching code (thus keep a copy of all codes)
* provide a wiki which stores its content to git - while allowing to
  edit online.
* there would be a away to compile the wiki to vim help files, too.
* be aware about renamings
* your ideas here
* .. And probably some more items ..
