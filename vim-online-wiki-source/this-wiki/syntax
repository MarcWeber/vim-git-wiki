= This wiki's syntax / markup =

== links/ references
{{{
Reference a wiki page: \\91[dir/file]] (press gf to follow a link in Vim)
External link: \\91[http(s)://domain|label]]
}}}
looks like:

    Reference a wiki page: [[dir/file]] (press gf to follow a link in Vim)
    External link: [[http(s)://domain|label]]

== headlines
{{{
= H1
== header level 2
}}}
(Looks like omitted, would be confusing)


== code blocks inline/multi line
{{{
A \\123{{ inline block }}\\125
\\123{{
A multiline
block
}}\\125
}}}
looks like:


A {{{ inline block }}}
{{{
A multiline
block
}}}

== lists
{{{
* Text
  more text (at least 2 spaces)
* second item

1) or use numbers
2)
}}}
looks like:

* Text
  more text (at least 2 spaces)
* second item

1) or use numbers
2)


== bold, strong text
{{{
\\42* bold text \\42*
}}}
looks like:

** bold text **

== feature matrices
first define feature list, then assign features to things:

{{{
FEATURES
blue:: is blue
fast:: is fast
loved_by_us:: we use it
eventually_loved_by_us:: we may use it also

MATRIX
emacs:: blue, fast, eventually_loved_by_us
vim:: blue, fast, loved_by_us
}}}

looks like:

FEATURES
blue:: is blue
fast:: is fast
loved_by_us:: we use it
eventually_loved_by_us:: we may use it also

MATRIX
emacs:: blue, fast, eventually_loved_by_us
vim:: blue, fast, loved_by_us

== quoting

Just use {{{<c-r>='\\'.nrtochar('{')}}} to quote the **{** character.
Eg that's useful to encode \\123{{ without starting a inline code block.
The wiki source will look like this then:

{{{
  \\92\\92\\49\\50\\51{{
}}}
