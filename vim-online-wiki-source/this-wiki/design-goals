= design goals of this wiki =
* provide high quality content
* keep it simple
* simpler solutions first
* editable by Vim
* editable by Browser
(see [[this-wiki/contributing]])

We keep things simple by using a plain text files, a simple convert-to-html.php
PHP script.

The wiki is editable by Vim: Its text you can checkout using git or download as
zip. gf (jumping to a file) works, links are always absolute, so that you can
use Vim's file completion <c-x><c-f>.

== We are aware of alternatives ==

Of course there are alternatives:
* markdown like syntax
* vim wiki
* online editable wiki [[topic/vimwiki-vs-mediawiki]]
* ..

If you think a different solution would serve the community much more, tell by
[[https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-git-wiki/issues/1||commenting]]

== Why Marc Weber initially didn't choose an alternative solution
Beacuse 
* html files cannot be hacked 
* he wanted to be able to edit the wiki offline
* he wanted to use Vim for editing, including grep etc (no compromises)
* he wants to make it easy to review changes - because nobody today knows
  everything. github naturally forces reviews
