[[plugins/eclim]]

On www.vim.org there is a viml only java parser. But AFAIK it is no longer
developped. It may work well for simple Java projects.

Most IDES (Netbeans, Eclipse, IDEA) implement Vim like modes today.
In the Eclipse case you have to pay some $ (viplugin).

IDES usually also implement
* fast completion
* on the fly error checking/compilation
* indexing (jump to code), thus browsing might be easier
* class hirarchy views
* debugging
...

Eg Eclipse implements "create method from usage" quickfix like stuff which
might be very helpful.

As alternative there is a headless Eclipse implementation which can be used to
provide some features for Vim even refactorings etc. Its called eclim. However
naturally you'll have some small overhead.
