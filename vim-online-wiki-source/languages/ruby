* [[topic/repl]] (Also have a look at pry which also supports completion and the like)

* vim-addon-rdebug (This seems to always work in some way for all ruby versions because it only depends on {{{require 'debug'}}})
* vim-addon-ruby-debug-ide
* vdebug
* vim-ruby-debugger (The last time I tried this it failed stepping even 10

Debugging libraries:
* ruby-debug-ide (linecache, ruby-debug-base) (only works nicely up to ruby 1.9.2 or older?)
* debugger (1.9.3/ 2.0?)
* byebug (eg use  https://github.com/astashov/debugger-xml which providesr rdebug-ide to talk to Vim?)


== completion
* vim-ruby
