Interesting plugins:
**ZenCoding** and **sparkup**: They both implement short ways to type html such as

{{{
    html>body>table>tr>3*td
}}}

which you can then expand to HTML


== interesting filetype specific commands and mappings ==
{{{
    command! -buffer FormatHTML %!xmllint --format --html %
}}}
You can create a similar command for htmltidy executable easily.
(Do you want to contribute it?)

== alternatives & additional tools ==
* Don't type html, use a DSL such as haml-lang.org or similar
* [[tips/browser-livereload]]
