= Vim and indentation

Tab: default behavior of vim is: add {{{&tabstop}}} spaces unless {{{expandtab}}} is not
set. You can always insert real tabs by {{{<c-v><tab>}}}. However {{{tabstob}}} should be
treated as display setting. Use {{{sw}}} setting and {{{c-t}}}, {{{c-d}}} instead.

{{{
  c-t: increase indentation
  c-d: decrease indentation
  c-f: auto indent current line (requires indentation setup)
  :setlocal sw=4: use 4 spacse for indentation
  :setlocal expandtab: expand tab to spaces (default)
  :setlocal tabstop: a tab is viewed as how many spaces in a file?

  :set list  : displays spaces and tabs
}}}

The {{{:h =}}} is the command which is commonly used for using the Vim's
indentation features. Some use cases:

>3j . .  increase indentation of 3 lines and repeat two times
V/ABC<cr>=  :select everything till ABC then reindent this block
}}}
