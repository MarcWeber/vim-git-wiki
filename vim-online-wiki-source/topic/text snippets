= text snippets =
When editing any kind of text often you have to type the same over and over again.
An example is a footer in an email or a conditional statement in a programming
language. The most simple way to automate this is using the 
{{{
  :abbrev command.
}}}
The next simple thing is create a mapping such as 
{{{
imap \insert Hello<space>World
# more advanced example:
imap \eemail_header <c-r>="Dear ".input("name: ")."\n"<cr>
}}}

This is all managable, however for longer texts it becomse tiresome. For that
reason special "snippet" or "template" plugins have been written. There are
many different snippet solutions. So let's compare them:

= Features: =

manual-reload: you have to reload snippet files
automatic-reload: Its enough to write a snippet file, it'll be reloaded automatically
runtimepath-support: Pick snippets by looking at &runtimepath
space-abstraction: Some projects require for(a; b; c) others require for ( a; b; c; )
can-read-snippets-files: snipmate is/was very popular. Comprehensive snippet collection can be found at [[http://github.com/honza/vim-snippets|vim-snippets]]

== XPTemplate: ==
  Features: manual-reload, space-abstraction
  mature engine, advanced features. Creating snippets takes some effort

== Sander's snipmate: ==
  Features: manual-reload, can-read-snippets-files
  original snipmate version.

== snipmate: ==
  Features: automatic-reload, runtimepath-support, can-read-snippets-files
  adds some features, therefore depends on additional libraries

== UltiSnips ==
  Features: manual-reload
  requires python, advanced features (nested placeholders)
  
== UltiSnipsF (github.com/MarcWeber/snipmate) ==
  Features: automatic-reload, runtimepath-support, can-read-snippets-files

  forked version of UltiSnips. Its goal is to merge communities of snipmate and
  UltiSnips by providing most important features to both communities.
  However the test suite is not up to date and maybe will never be updated,
  because everything Marc Weber cares about works

== neo snippets ==
  can-read-snippets-files
  (This feature list is incomplete)

== others ==
  Add them
