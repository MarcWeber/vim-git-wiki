= vim and read print eval loops =

repl is a shortcut for read print eval loop. Usually this means "run an
interpreter in an interactive way". REPLs exist for many languages:
  irb (ruby)
  php -a (php)
  scala

and many more.

vim-addon-async implements REPL completion for python and ruby (eventually scala).

Conque Shell allows running any terminal apps (including shells), but you can't
use vim editing keys
