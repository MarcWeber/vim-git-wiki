Vim as bad at async communication. Still some workarounds exist.
You may want to look at github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-async which is
using github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-background-cmd which is running a
background shell which calls back into Vim to tell it "job is ready"
by using client-server feature which in turn requires X (or use vim nox
patch)

Alternative solutions exist which use Vim's idle event to poll for
updates. See list of related projects in github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-async
which also lists yet another Vim patch (terminal version only).
The async implementation provides a similar API for VimL plugins, but is
also using the vim-addon-background-cmd way calling back into Vim using
client-server. For quickfix I don't use -async because its causing a
noticable delay IMHO.

There is still one difference: Emacs updates a grep /compile list while
you can continue editing. vim-addon-async, vimproc, .. are vim like
solutions.

For an older version of Vim there is als a thread patch which allows to
run a terminal in vim, or see ConqueTerm.

While the order of projects listed here might be biased (cause I'm the
author), I still hope that the overall overview is kind of complete.
