= finding a Vim plugin
Traditionally use [[http://vim.sourceforge.net/search.php||search on vim.sf.net]].
Don't care too much about the ratings. They have been spoofed many times. Eg Dr
Chip even removed his plugins from vim.sf.net for that reason.

However today no longer all plugins can be found on vim.sf.net. You also want
to try code hosting sites developpers use to put their code on:
  * github
  * bitbucket
  * gitorious
  * code.google.com
