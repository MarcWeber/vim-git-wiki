= Pasting text in Vim =
Vim sees input as coming from a terminal (even gui Vim implements kind of terminal internally).
Thus it cannot make a **difference** between you **typing** and you **pasting**.

You tell Vim that you want to paste verbatim as is you {{{:set paste}}}.
You can create a mapping like this:
{{{
  map \ip :set invpaste
}}}

On linux {{{:r!cat}}} then paste then {{{<c-d>}}} to end is a fast alternative.

Also see {{{:h 'clipboard'}}} to make Vim use or not use various linux clipboards.
Use {{{p/P}}} to paste text before/after the cursor and {{{y}}} to yank text.
Vim supports multiple registers, eg {{{"ay}}} / {{{"ap}}} yanks/pasts into the a register.
See {{{:h registers}}}

Pasting registers can also be done by {{{<c-r>a}}} in insert mode, a being any
register.
