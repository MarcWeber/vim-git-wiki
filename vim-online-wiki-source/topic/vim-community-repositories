= vim community repositories
I and ZyX (and Shougo?) are maintaining [[http://bitbucket.org/vimcommunity]]
The reason to have a "community" maintained orginization like thing is that
individuals can go on holidays (or drop out) without affecting the overall
community. Eg if an author of a github account vanishes (for whatever reason)
it usually takes a long time to find out for, and tell people about new
upstreams. Having many maintainers leads to better code and better service.

If you want to join just contact MarcWeber by mail or on irc.freenode (or ZyX).


== github organrizations vs bitbucket

Most items contributed by Zyx (Thanks!):

**both support:**
* replying by mail
* git repositories
* issue trackers
* ...


**Bitbucket pros:**

* Mercurial support.
* Bug tracker with components, priorities, more statuses.
* Bug tracker with advanced search.
* Bug tracker with issues import.
* Bug tracker with votes.
* No space limit.
* (not related to vim-pi) No limit on private repositories.
* Better PR design decision: diff is shown right on the first page. It is more interesting then commit list, though diff and commit list would be better. When I give some remarks regarding the PR I usually give it regarding the code and not commit messages or number of commits.
* Better main user page design decision: when I look at the user page I usually use it to navigate to user repository and do not want to see user activity.

**Github pros:**

* Diff views work faster.
* Better mobile version.
* No need to update PR from web interface when adding each new commit.
* Though search is not as flexible, for usual cases it is much more convenient. (Still note that for some unusual cases it is simply impossible to perform what you want: e.g. after I labeled issues in powerline issue tracker I found myself wanting to find issues which have specific label present and other specific label not present.)
* Issue tracker labels are more flexible.
* Issue tracker has inline issues search (I mean what happens if you type a hash).
* Some markdown features are missing in bitbucket.
* Github issues tracker has per-issue TODO list. It also has a way to reference issues from other projects.
* Reply by email works far better.
* probably bigger community
* Allows to assign a key with push access to individual repositories

So which one is better?
Is Vim using mercurial as strong reason (there are two git mirrors @ github)
