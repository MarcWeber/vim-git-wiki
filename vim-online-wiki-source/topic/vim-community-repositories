= vim community repositories
I and ZyX (and Shougo?) are maintaining [[http://bitbucket.org/vimcommunity]]
The reason to have a "community" maintained orginization like thing is that
individuals can go on holidays (or drop out) without affecting the overall
community. Eg if an author of a github account vanishes (for whatever reason)
it usually takes a long time to find out for, and tell people about new
upstreams. Having many maintainers leads to better code and better service.

If you want to join just contact MarcWeber by mail or on irc.freenode (or ZyX).


== github organrizations vs bitbucket
FEATURES
issue_or_bug_tracker::
can_reply_by_mail_to_issues::
git_support::
mercurial_support::
push_key_for_one_project:: Allows to assign a key with push access to individual repositories
biggest_community:: Well - we all just think github is almost standard ..

MATRIX
bitbucket:: issue_or_bug_tracker, can_reply_by_mail_to_issues, git_support, mercurial_support
github:: issue_or_bug_tracker, can_reply_by_mail_to_issues, git_support, push_key_for_one_project, biggest_community

So which one is better?
Is Vim using mercurial as strong reason (there are two git mirrors @ github)

**push_key_for_one_project**:
bitbucket has deploy keys
