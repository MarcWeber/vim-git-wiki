= running tools or compilers =

The well known standard way is something like this:
{{{
compiler java
:set makeprg=javac
:make %
}}}

great: you can cancel compilation by pressing ctrl-c. Bad: You see all lines
scroll by (which may even be slow).

There are a lot of additional plugins which can also run compilers.

= vim-addon-actions =
  Implements running compiler for many languages and let's you bind this to a
  key or the buf write event

= syntastic =
nice for simple scripts, but runs the interpreter for some languages :(

= more =
on www.vim.org there are many more solutions
