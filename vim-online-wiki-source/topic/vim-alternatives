author says
* no scripting built in
* no threading
* ...

My view: Nice idea, but threading is important, eg do syntax highlighting
calculation in the background, redraw when finished.
Thus while some ideas might be cool, I don't think it will serve everybody.

* compiles
* uses lua as scripting language
* written in C++

== Yi
* Haskell
* threading
* emacs/vi like interface
* strong parsers for highlighting
* still needs more love, eg doesn't support working JS highlighting yet
