= Installing & compiling Vim =

First thing to learn is that there is not one single "vim".

There are many "vi" clones - and "VIM" (vi improved) which this wiki is about
can be compiled in many different ways - eg "huge" and "small".

Some linux distributions ship with a clone (nvi) or with a minimal version.
Often its your task to install a "huge" version first.

If you need help try irc [[topic/vim-irc-on-freenode]]
