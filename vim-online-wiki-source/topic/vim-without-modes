== Vim without modes
Well, of course Vim users think the modes of Vim ore the most powerful feature
of Vim. However there are some cases where people use Vim only once in a while,
and then learning and remembering all the keys is overkill. In those cases you can
make Vim behave almost like a regular editor: 

{{{
" put into your ~/.vimrc
" details see :h 'insertmode'
set insertmode
}}}
