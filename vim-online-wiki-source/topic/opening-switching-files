= opening switching files in vim =
Opening and switching between buffers/ files is very related.
Often you want to edit a file and don't care about whether you've previously
opened it. There are many ways to help with it

== related tips ==
[[tips/auto-create-directories-before-writing]]

== using vim only tools ==
{{{
typing ctrl-o: open last file (after restarting vim)
:e/n **/*foo.txt<c-d> or <tab> to find a file

:enew|r!find<cr> then gf/gF on a file

" this is very useful, because typing some characters and <tab> expanding is enough:
map lhs :b<space>
}}}

== using additional plugins ==
[[https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree|The_NERD_tree]] is popular, because it has a tree view.

[[https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager/blob/master/autoload/sample_vimrc_for_new_users.vim|sample_vimrc_for_new_users.vim]]
has a very simple glob open implementation. Many famous alternatives exist:

Command-T plugin (requires ruby, thus you may have little trouble setting it up)
ctrlp.vim
FuzzyFinder
(How do they compare, which plugin do people prefer for what reason?)

(TODO)

also [topics/tags] like features can be used.
