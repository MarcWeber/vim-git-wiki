== commenting text ==

Most programming languages have special characters such as
{{{
# PHP, cmake, (endless more langugaes)
// C/C++, (endless more)
-- SQL

or multiline comments
{- Haskell -}
/* C++ C etc */
}}}

== How to remove comments ? ==
**drop #** at the beginning: (jj representing any up/down movement):
{{{
  <c-v>jjd
}}}
or by regex:
{{{
  %s@^#@@
}}}

== How to add comments ? ==
**add #** at the beginning: (jj representing any up/down movement)
{{{
  <c-v>jjI#<esc>
}}}
or by regex:
{{{
  %s@^#@@
}}}

== VimL special case
You can use "finish" make Vim ignore rest of the file. (Nice for keeping your own memories etc).
You're missing {{{/* .. */}}} ? try {{{if 0 ... endif }}}
