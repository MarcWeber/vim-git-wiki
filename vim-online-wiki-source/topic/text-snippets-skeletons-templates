= text snippets, skeletons, templates =
When editing any kind of text often you have to type the same over and over again.
An example is a footer in an email or a conditional statement in a programming
language. The most simple way to automate this is using the 
{{{
  :abbrev command.
}}}
The next simple thing is create a mapping such as 
{{{
imap \insert Hello<space>World
# more advanced example:
imap \eemail_header <c-r>="Dear ".input("name: ")."\n"<cr>
}}}

This is all managable, however for longer texts it becomse tiresome. For that
reason special "snippet" or "template" plugins have been written. There are
many different snippet solutions. So let's compare them:

= Features: =

FEATURES
manual-reload:: you have to reload snippet files
automatic-reload:: Its enough to write a snippet file, it'll be reloaded automatically
runtimepath-support:: Pick snippets by looking at &runtimepath
space-abstraction:: Some projects require for(a; b; c) others require for ( a; b; c; )
can-read-snippets-files:: snipmate is very popular. Comprehensive snippet collection can be found at [[http://github.com/honza/vim-snippets|vim-snippets]]

nested placeholders::

MATRIX
XPTemplate:: manual-reload, space-abstraction
Sander's snipmate:: manual-reload, can-read-snippets-files
snipmate:: automatic-reload, runtimepath-support, can-read-snippets-files
UltiSnips:: manual-reload
UltiSnipsF:: automatic-reload, runtimepath-support, can-read-snippets-files, requires-python, nested placeholders
neo snippets:: can-read-snippets-files
vim-template:: info-missing

== Additional notes ==

**XPTemplate**: mature engine, advanced features. Creating snippets takes some effort

**Sander's snipmate**: original snipmate version.

**snipmate**: adds some features, therefore depends on additional libraries

**UltiSnipsF**:
  forked version of UltiSnips. Its goal is to merge communities of snipmate and
  UltiSnips by providing most important features to both communities.
  However the test suite is not up to date and maybe will never be updated,
  because everything Marc Weber cares about works
  
  UltiSnips will soon have a new release containing most of these changes

**neo snippets**:
