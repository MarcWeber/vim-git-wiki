== vipi ==
draft for creating a vi plugin index or such. Name has been suggested by Shougo.

Features it should have:

* be simple

* low maintainance (make people maintain their own stuff, only provide the
  infrastructure)

* allow associating mirrors (eg vim-scripts.org, another example is UltiSnips,
  github is only a mirror)

* allow assigning unique simple names to plugins like VAM-kr did.

* associate vim.sf.net information with github/bitbucket/.. sources
  (ZyX did most of this work already)

* think about a code search / view feature



== questions

How important is versioning? Is causing more work to keep version information up to date?
