= addon-info.json (official minimal documentation)
VAM introduced addon-info.json to document important properties 
of Vim plugins such as:

* author
* upstream
* dependencies
* additional custom meta data (be open to everyone)

JSON format has been chosen because

* Vim can read it (almost [1]) natively by using eval (even though its evil, but
  you trust a plugin anyway)
* its likely that other tools can read JSON, too
* its very simple for humans to edit, too
* its widely known (due to popularity by JavaScript)


== most important keys

**runtimepath**:

Some repositories have a "vim/" subdirectory which needs to be used intsead of root.
This key indicates this. Examples are sparkup,merlin,vimwiki,vimbufsync.

**depedencies**: (VAM only?) See example below

== VAM's usage ==

{{{
  {
    'depedencies': {
    'name': { opts-as-in-addon-info.json }
    }
  }
}}}


opts are usually empty, but you could use the "url" key to tell VAM where to
download the dependency. Usually the download location is derived from [[topic/vim-pi]] pool.

VAM's documentation lists more keys, which can be used, but they don't have
very important meaning. We could think about supporting keys

* forcing versions (eg git hash of a dependency)
* version constraints (like cabal which is the haskell package manager)
* ...

All keys are described in VAM's documentation

== future
Some proposals exist to declare versioned dependendencies, reciepes about how to unpack sources etc

== historical notes
VAM still contains some legacy code to support the older .json file names which
contained the plugin name.
