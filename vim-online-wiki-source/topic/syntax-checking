[[http://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic|Syntastic]] seems to be the most

[[http://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-syntax-checker|vim-addon-syntax-checker]]
does only syntax checking and never runs code. It also provides a nice {{{SyntaxCheckerDebug}}}
command which makes you aware about what checkers are available, which ones of those can be used
