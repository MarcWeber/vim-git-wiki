= debugging viml related stuff

**which viml lines get executed?**:
{{{
vim -V20/tmp/log
}}}
Then have a look at the log

**debugging viml**:
{{{
debug expr
E.g :debug RunCommand args
}}}
Then use c(ontinue) s(tep) n(ext) q(uit) i(nterrupt) f(inish), see {{{:h debug}}}
Also see {{{:h :breakadd}}}

Note: After starting the debugger you can run arbitrary viml code in the
command line shown by the debugger

**tracing***:
{{{
  echom string(thing)
  echoe string(thing)
}}}
Then you have the traces in {{{:messages}}} log always

**debugging syntax scripts**:
Note: echo lines are ignored by Vim. However you can run an indentation
function manually and read them:

{{{
fun MyIndent(lnum)
  echo 'debug ..'
  return 1
endfun
set indentexpr=MyIndent(v:lnum)
" debug indentation of current line:
echo MyIndent(line('.'))
}}}

**error messages like 23.34.23 line 3**:
This mean that the methods 23 34 23 are memebers of dictionaries.
You can view the code by :function{23}

**where has a mapping been defined?**:
{{{
  :verbose map
}}}


**Has a plugin been loaded?**:
Check {{{:scriptnames}}}

**A mapping does not work the way it should?**:
Has it been (re)mapped?
{{{:verbose map {lhs} }}}
shows where a mapping has been set last. Maybe a second plugin is overriding a
mapping.
