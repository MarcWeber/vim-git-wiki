= Introduction =
This wiki is a manually index telling you about which tools & workflows will
get your job done using Vim. If there are tools outside of Vim, its ok to list
them too, because we are not blind and we know that we should pick the best
tool for a job - which happens to be Vim very often whenever we edit text.
